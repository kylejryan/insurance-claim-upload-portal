Re: Claim for Rear-End Collision â€“ Policy #A12345

Dear Claims Adjuster,

On December 5th, I was involved in a rear-end collision at the intersection of Main St. and 3rd Ave in Austin, TX. I was stopped at a red light when the at-fault driver (admitted liability) struck my vehicle from behind. My 2019 Toyota Camry sustained significant damage to the rear bumper and trunk. I also visited the emergency room later that day and was diagnosed with whiplash.

I request prompt processing of this claim under my policy. Attached: police report, medical report, and repair estimate.

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Sincerely,
John Smith
