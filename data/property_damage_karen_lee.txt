Subject: Roof Damage from Storm â€“ Claim Notification

Dear HomeGuard Team,

On January 4, 2025, a severe windstorm uprooted a large oak tree onto my house roof in Richmond, VA. This resulted in extensive structural and water damage throughout the first floor. I relocated temporarily and enclosed photos of damage, hotel receipts, and contractor estimates.

I appreciate your swift handling of restoration and reimbursement. Please confirm receipt and next steps.

Kind regards,
Karen Lee
