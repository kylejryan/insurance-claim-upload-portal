Subject: Dog Bite at Public Park

Dear Claims Team,

On October 5, 2024, I was bitten by a dog while jogging in Orlando, FL. The dog was off-leash and unrestrained. I required stitches and a tetanus shot, and have visible scarring. Hospital and veterinary reports are included.

I am seeking reimbursement for medical treatment and scar revision.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
Sarah Jones
