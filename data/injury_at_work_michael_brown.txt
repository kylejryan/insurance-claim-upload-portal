Subject: Claimed Injury at Warehouse Site

Dear Claims Processing Team,

I am submitting a claim for a workplace injury sustained on November 20, 2024, at the Dallas Warehouse. I slipped on an unmarked wet floor, dislocated my shoulder, and tore a ligament. Attached are my doctor's report, surgical notes, and rehabilitation plan. I have not been cleared to return to work.

Please initiate my medical and wage-loss claims.

Thank you,
Michael Brown
