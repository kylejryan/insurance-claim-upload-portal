Subject: Flash Flood Damage, No Flood Coverage

Dear Claims Department,

Heavy rainfall on March 9th caused flash flooding at my home in Baton Rouge, LA. Carpets, electronics, and furniture were destroyed. My policy excludes flood coverage, but I am submitting details for potential appeal. Photos and receipts are attached.

Please confirm if any discretionary coverage is available.

Respectfully,
Tina Cole
