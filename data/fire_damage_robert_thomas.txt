Subject: Kitchen Grease Fire & Property Damage

Dear Claims Representative,

A grease fire broke out in my Boulder, CO kitchen on February 1st, 2025. Firefighters responded promptly, but smoke and water caused significant damage throughout the first floor. I have attached the fire department report, repair estimates, and inventory of damaged items.

I appreciate your expeditious handling for reimbursement.

Sincerely,
Robert Thomas
