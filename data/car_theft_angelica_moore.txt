Subject: Theft Claim – 2018 Honda Accord

Dear SecureAuto Adjuster,

On March 14, 2025, my vehicle—a 2018 Honda Accord—was stolen from my apartment complex parking garage in Sacramento, CA. It was recovered three days later with major parts missing (tires, stereo). The police and tow yard photos are attached.

Estimate for damages is approximately $5,200. I request evaluation and claim resolution under comprehensive theft coverage.

Best,
